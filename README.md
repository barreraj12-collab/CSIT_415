# CSIT_415
This is my CSIT 415 repository for this class this helps me build my skills and how to apply to this course. The first thing I did was create a Github accoount then I went on to create a repository. Then I committed a couple of changes and searched an image of my favoriyte animal, and saved it to my computer. Then I created another branch to upload the image of my favorite animal.
